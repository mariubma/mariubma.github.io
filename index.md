# About
As an analyst in the actuarial function of an insurance company, my day-to-day consists of coding, statistics, and data analysis.
In broad strokes, my scientific interests are centered around brains, physics, and machine learning. 
Besides work and science, my time is mostly spent reading or training jiu-jitsu.
